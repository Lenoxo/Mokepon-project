# Mokepon

Mokepon is a game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a game similar to Pok√©mon and supports 2 players per round.

The frontend of the game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any frameworks. The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js. This project is my first programming endeavor.

### Game Round Explanation

The game consists of 3 stages during each round:

1. **Character Selection:** Players can choose one of three characters - Capipepo, Ratigueya, or Hipodoge.
2. **Map Exploration:** Players navigate a map to find the opposing player. 
3. **Battle:** Once the players collide, a battle begins where they must select 5 attacks in any order. The battle follows a rock-paper-scissors logic, where water defeats fire, fire defeats earth, and earth defeats water. The winner of the round is determined based on the damage received from the opponent. Players can restart to play another round.
